This website was built using Next.js Framework.

I recommend you to check it's [official tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) to learn more about this wonderful framework for react.

Its main benefits are the support of SSR (Server-side rendering), which is very important for SEO purposes.
